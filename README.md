# Boids_Boi
Trying to replicate (albeit unsuccessfully) the phenomenon of boids using Ursina in a naive manner.

Please install the Ursina module before running the code. More about that [here](https://www.ursinaengine.org/).

## This is an attempt to copy the simulation created by Ben Eater using Vanilla JavaScript

[Link to his code](https://github.com/beneater/boids)

This is done in order to learn Ursina, and also probably create some new and interesting simulations.

- As of yet, the code is very inefficient, if the number of boids is increased beyond 20, then it starts getting choppy.
- Couldn't figure out a way to rotate the boids in their direction of motion. Need to work on that.

Here the number of boids is 40, so the fps is comparatively low.
